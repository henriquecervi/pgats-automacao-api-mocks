# 📊 GitHub Pages - Test Reports

This project is configured to automatically publish test reports on **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🔄 Automatic Process
1. **Push to `main` branch** → Triggers Pages workflow
2. **Test execution** → Report generation with Mochawesome
3. **Automatic deploy** → Publication on GitHub Pages
4. **Accessible URL** → Reports available online

### 🌐 Report URLs

After the first deploy, reports will be available at:

```
🏠 Main Page: https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/
📊 HTML Report: https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/test-report.html
📈 JSON Data: https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/test-report.json
```

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Click on **Pages** (sidebar menu)
3. In **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Save settings

### 2. Make the First Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Pages for test reports"

## 🔧 Advantages

### 🌐 **Sharing**

- Automatic report history

### 📱 **Accessibility**

## 🔄 Updates

Reports are automatically updated on every:
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual workflow execution
- Merged pull request

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Main Page
Edit the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` file in the section that generates `index.html`:

```yaml
- name: 📋 Generate index page
  run: |
    cat > public/index.html << 'EOF'
    <!-- Your custom HTML here -->
    EOF
```

### Add More Reports
1. Generate new files in the `public/` folder
2. Add links in the main page
3. Commit and push to publish
